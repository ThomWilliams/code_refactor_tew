CODING BOOTCAMP: HOMEWORK 1: CODE REFACTOR

Coding refactor excerise to create a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the website is SEO optimised. HTML has been made more accessible and CSS moderately reconfigured.


# Project Acceptance Criteria + The Steps Made to Meet Each

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

---> The website's accesibility was improved using good HTML semantic practice, as cross-referenced with the sources referred to below. A selection of additonal amendments were also made as noted below. 


WHEN I view the source code // THEN I find semantic HTML elements

---> Semantic HTML elements defined incl: header, footer, section, article tags. 
---> <Span> tag in h1 tag replaced (+ CSS amended accordingly)


WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements // THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

---> Minor modification of HTML to ensure it follows logical structure.


WHEN I view the image element // THEN I find accessible alt attributes

---> alt attibute and alt-text descriptions added to all featured images. 
---> Title attribute used to define figure tag (lead image inserted via css as class="hero"). 


WHEN I view the heading attributes // THEN they fall in sequential order
---> h1, h2, h3 put in logical sequential order
--->  h2 Heading previously in footer given new css class of "made" 

WHEN I view the title element // THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
---> Website title updated to "Horiseon: Offical Website"


ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS

----> Nav Bar: Broken link to "Search Engine Optimisation" section fixed.
----> CSS consolidated where posisble and reorganised into logical structure corresponding to HTML order. 
----> CSS file commented with appropriate sections / fucntions.
----> Unnecessary header class removed and updated in CSS file.
----> Div class in style.css file updated to new class of "Nav"
----> Select footer text given new class of "made" (instead of h2) to accomodate desired larger font size
